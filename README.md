# PyReaderOS

![](./doc/logo.jpg)

PyReaderOS (name subject to change) is a Window Manager + Python UI + Packages combo built on top of [Postmarket OS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Kobo_Clara_HD_(kobo-clara)) for the Kobo Clara HD.

Some features, including suspend and hardware interactions (leds and screens) work thanks to [Air](https://github.com/bjesus/air) by @bjesus and the Postmarket OS wiki.
